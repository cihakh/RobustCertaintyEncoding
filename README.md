# RobustCertaintyEncoding

This repository will contain sample code used to generate figures and results in the paper entitled ``Robustly encoding certainty in a neural circuit model'' by Heather L Cihak and Zachary P Kilpatrick (submitted to...).
As of right now, the code is being polished and placed into a Jupyter notebook and will appear here once completed.
